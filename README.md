### Hi there, I'm gidra ðŸ‘‹
With over 5 months of DevOps practices, I have used GCP and Azure as my primary cloud environments for project deployment.
I have used Docker, GitHub Actions, Helm, and Flux to implement the CI/CD pipeline for my pet project.
As my latest and greatest achievement, I've deployed an OpenTelemetry monitoring stack consisting of Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki.
During the period of my DevOps Practices, I've understood and implemented methodologies such as CI/CD, GitOps and IaC.
Also, I'm a member of the "DevOps Geeks" community, where we collaborate on projects and provide support to each other.
I'm currently actively expanding my knowledge and expertise in the DevOps domain, I am always open to new connections and always ready to apply my knowledge to real projects.
